**Education team receives prestigious accolade for exceptional contribution in enhancing Learning Indicators.**

Professors from the Center for Studies, Development, and Innovation in Software (CEDIS) at the University of Brasília (UnB) have achieved a notable milestone in the field of education by receiving an Honorable Mention in the category "Improvement of learning indicators," as part of the first edition of the UnB Annual Undergraduate Teaching Innovation Award, according to the DEG Notice No. 25/2023.

The honored professors are Cristiane Soares Ramos and Sergio Antônio Andrade de Freitas, in collaboration with colleagues Marcia Mortari, Eduardo Bessa, and Dianne Magalhães, all members of the A3M Program ([Learning for the 3rd Millennium](http://www.a3m.unb/)). This group stood out in the educational landscape for their significant contribution to improving teaching-learning processes.

This honor reflects the impact of the book "Learning Indicators," a collective work by these professors, available on the UnB portal [here](https://livros.unb.br/index.php/portal/catalog/book/442). This book symbolizes the professors' commitment and dedication to developing innovative teaching methods, tailored to the contemporary needs of the education sector.

The award highlights the importance of innovation and creativity in higher education, especially in times of rapid changes and new educational challenges. The collaborative and interdisciplinary approach adopted by the professors of the A3M Program and CEDIS demonstrates how pedagogical innovations can be effectively implemented to enhance learning indicators.

This recognition not only celebrates the success of the CEDIS professors but also serves as an inspiration to educators and academic institutions globally, reinforcing the significance of educational strategies that are inclusive, adaptable, and future-oriented.
