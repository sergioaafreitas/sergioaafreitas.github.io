The strong use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) originated in the 70s, became popular in the 90s, contributing to increased consumption, improved quality of life, and well-being of people in the information society, connected by various services of both commercial and governmental natures. In this context, terms such as electronic government, e-Government, and Digital Government emerged, along with concerns about the _Digital Divide_, reflecting on digital inclusion/exclusion as factors impacting the social inclusion of various populations. The impacts necessitate formulating digital transformation strategies for the involved organizations and institutions.

The Brazilian Federal Government's Digital Public Services Transformation project involves research, development, and innovation in methodologies, models, and tools that promote the automation and digitization of public services offered by the Ministry of Economy (ME), by the Special Secretariat for Debureaucratization, Management, and Digital Government (specifically by the Secretariat of Digital Government (SGD), aiming at the transformation of federal public services. The project was established between UnB (ITRAC Laboratory of the Faculty of Gama) and the ME.

Participation: Prof. Dr. George Marsicano collaborates individually with the Brazilian Federal Government's Digital Public Services Transformation project, alongside the ITRAC Laboratory, mainly in the areas of Agile Project Management, Software Requirements, Software Engineering, and Software Development Approaches.

As another initiative, the ongoing doctoral project of Prof. MSc Ricardo Kosloski, discussing the impact factors associated with the area of software quality, on the use of e-Gov services by elderly people, a population continuously growing worldwide, as well as in Brazil.

In the Brazilian context, after a population growth peak between the 50s/60s, improvements in medicine and hygiene minimized mortality rates. Subsequently, social phenomena such as family planning, urbanization, migration flows, and the participation of women in the workforce balanced mortality and fertility rates, resulting in more modest demographic growth and consequently in the aging of the Brazilian population, following a global trend. Moreover, involving specific populations in the digital transformation process aims to give them a voice and empowerment towards achieving an e-Democracy characteristic of the information society, according to international guidelines established by works like _Nothing about us, without us_ (CHARLTON, 2004).
