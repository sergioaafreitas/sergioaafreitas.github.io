## Introduction
Software Product Line Engineering is a specialized area within software engineering, focusing on the efficient development of a family of related software products. This discipline involves creating a common architecture and a set of shared components, allowing for customization and the generation of multiple software product variants from a common base. This field is essential for enhancing software reuse, reducing development costs and time, and increasing the quality and consistency across software products.

At CEDIS, Software Product Line Engineering is a key area of research, development, and innovation. Coordinated by Prof. Andr√© Lanna, the research line focuses on advancing practices, techniques, and tools related to this area. The team of researchers is dedicated to studying and improving methods for modeling common and variable features, customization strategies, dependency management, and integrating new technologies. The goal is to explore how software product lines can be efficiently designed, implemented, and maintained, contributing to the efficiency and competitiveness of companies in the software market. The research in this area aims not only to enhance theoretical understanding but also to apply this knowledge in practice, assisting organizations in optimizing their large-scale software development.
