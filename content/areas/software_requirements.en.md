## Introduction
The area of Software Requirements is pivotal in software engineering as it deals with defining and managing the needs and functionalities that a software system must have. This discipline is crucial for ensuring that the developed systems meet the end users' and project stakeholders' expectations and needs. The process involves identifying, documenting, verifying, and maintaining requirements throughout the software lifecycle.

At CEDIS, Software Requirements is a research, development, and application area with a strong focus on improving processes and techniques for collecting, analyzing, and managing requirements. This research line is coordinated by Prof. George Marsicano and features a team of dedicated researchers. They explore topics such as requirements elicitation, modeling, specification, validation, and requirements management. The goal is to develop more efficient and accurate methods to ensure that software systems align perfectly with business needs and user expectations, thereby contributing to the creation of high-quality and relevant software products in the market.
