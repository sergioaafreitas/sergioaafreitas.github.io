## Research Team

- Ricardo Ajax Dias Kosloski, Professor in the Software Engineering course.
- George Marsicano Côrrea, Professor in the Software Engineering course.

## Ongoing Projects

- **Teaching Project, "Software Development" Course, Prof. Sérgio Freitas:** Revitalized through gamification "Dawn Feudal" and inspired by a feudal scenario and based on the Octalysis model, this approach transforms learning into an interactive journey, where students face practical software development challenges, promoting skills like critical thinking and collaboration. The playful experience not only engages students but also prepares them for real-world software challenges.
Available resources: MS Power Apps mobile app, SharePoint site, Power BI dashboards, and a thematic player's guide, all integrated into the Microsoft 365 platform.
Start: 2021, status: ongoing.

- **Teaching Project, "Human-Computer Interaction" Course, Prof. Sérgio Freitas:** Offered in the Software Engineering course at the University of Brasília, adopted an innovative pedagogical approach through the implementation of gamification in the form of a Feudal RPG, based on the Octalysis model and called "HCI Journey." This methodology aims to enrich the learning process, making it more attractive and efficient for students. By integrating elements of RPG games, such as battles, quests, and missions, into the academic curriculum, gamification seeks to facilitate the understanding of the fundamental concepts of the discipline, while stimulating student engagement and motivation throughout the semester.
Available resources: MS Power Apps mobile app, SharePoint site, and a thematic player's guide, all integrated into the Microsoft 365 platform.
Start: 2022, status: ongoing.

### Courses / Classes

1. FREITAS, Sergio A. A.; RAMOS, CRISTIANE SOARES; MORTARI, Márcia R.; VIANA, Diane M.; BESSA, Eduardo. *Workshop - Learning Indicators*, 2022. (Short course/Other).

2. *Fundamentals of Computer Architecture, Gamified as "Knowledge Battle"*: The course restructured as "Knowledge Battle", a gamified educational experience. This innovative format, based on the concepts of McGonigal and the Octalysis framework, transforms the classroom into an interactive learning space. Students participate in knowledge duels, answering questions about topics from the discipline, and earn "coins" based on the quality of their responses. The contents are previously available through the textbooks adopted in the discipline, encouraging prior study. Gamification proved effective in increasing student engagement and enjoyment in the learning process. 2015. Author: Sergio Freitas. Resources available: Standardized forms for monitoring duels and spreadsheets for identifying similar performance profiles. Start: 2015, concluded in 2017.
