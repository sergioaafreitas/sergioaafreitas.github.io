## Ongoing projects
1. Research project "[Gamification of the Canal Ciência Portal](https://www.cedis.unb.br/projetos/canal-ci%C3%AAncia)": the project aims to enrich the user experience of the portal, using advanced gamification techniques based on the Octalysis tool. Start: 2023, status: ongoing.
2. Teaching project, "Software Development" course: Revitalized by the "Feudal Dawn" gamification and inspired by a feudal scenario and based on the Octalysis model, this approach transforms learning into an interactive journey, where students face practical challenges of software development, promoting skills such as critical thinking and collaboration. The playful experience not only engages students but also prepares them for real challenges in the software field.  
    Available resources: MS Power Apps mobile app, Sharepoint site, Power BI dashboards, and a thematic player's guide, all integrated into the Microsoft 365 platform. Start: 2021, status: ongoing.
3. Teaching project, "Human-Computer Interaction" course: offered in the Software Engineering course at the University of Brasília, adopted an innovative pedagogical approach through the implementation of a gamification in the form of Feudal RPG, based on the Octalysis model and called "HCI Journey". This methodology aims to enrich the learning process, making it more attractive and efficient for students. Integrating RPG game elements, such as battles, quests, and missions, into the academic curriculum, the gamification seeks to facilitate the understanding of fundamental concepts of the discipline, while stimulating student engagement and motivation throughout the semester.  
    Available resources: MS Power Apps mobile app, Sharepoint site, and a thematic player's guide, all integrated into the Microsoft 365 platform. Start: 2022, status: ongoing.
4. [Process] GCMP - process for the development of gamified Chatbots, Start: 2022, status: ongoing.
5. Gamification in Organizational Contexts, Start: 2021, status: ongoing.

### Courses / Classes
1. [Portal for training and identifying the motivational profile of a target audience to be gamified](https://publish.obsidian.md/sergio-freitas): A web portal designed for training and identifying the motivational profile of a target audience for gamification. This portal includes practical sections for judge teams to evaluate motivational profiles. The resulting motivational profile is an Octalysis profile. Teams monitor the development of motivational profiles and compare them with others. The portal uses questionnaires for profile creation and is constantly evolving to incorporate new methods of identifying motivational profiles. 2023. Author: [Sergio Freitas](https://www.cedis.unb.br/people/sergio-a-a-freitas). Private site, available only upon request to the author.
2. Fundamentals of Computer Architecture, gamified as "Knowledge Battle": The restructured class as "Knowledge Battle," a gamified educational experience. This innovative format, based on McGonigal's concepts and the Octalysis framework, transforms the classroom into an interactive learning space. Students participate in knowledge duels, answering questions about class topics, and earn "patacas" based on the quality of their answers. The contents are previously made available through the textbooks adopted in the class, encouraging prior study. Gamification proved effective in increasing student engagement and enjoyment in the learning process. 2015. Author: [Sergio Freitas](https://www.cedis.unb.br/people/sergio-a-a-freitas).  
    Available resources: Standardized forms for monitoring duels and spreadsheets for identifying similar player profiles. Start: 2015, concluded in 2017.
### Packages
1. Journey to Mars - gamification developed for team training in agile methodologies. Part of the project with the Ministry of Economy, via ITRAC. Developed entirely using the tools available on the MS 365 platform (Sharepoint, Forms, Automate, etc), 2022.
