## Project Description

Under the guidance of researchers [Sergio Freitas](/en/people/sergio_freitas) and [Cristiane Ramos](/en/people/cristiane_ramos), this project aims to enhance the user experience of Canal Ciência. By employing advanced gamification techniques, we propose a more engaging and motivating approach to scientific dissemination.
## Project Objectives

The core objectives of this project are multiple:
1. Identify the target audience of Canal Ciência;
2. Develop motivational profiles with the help of the Octalisys tool;
3. Establish indicators to evaluate user satisfaction and motivation; and
4. Implement gamification on the Canal Ciência Portal.
A crucial aspect is the rigorous evaluation of the gamified version of Canal Ciência, aiming to measure its impact on the user experience and the effectiveness of scientific content dissemination through the use of gamification.
## Methodology and Implementation

The implementation of this initiative will take place on the WordPress platform, the current base of Canal Ciência. Gamification techniques will be carefully integrated, and their effectiveness monitored through specific indicators created by the CEDIS team. This will allow continuous adjustments and enhancements to the project.
## Team

This project benefits from the collaboration between CEDIS and IBICT experts, coordinated by Leda Sampson (IBICT). It also includes the participation of Software Engineering students as Undergraduate Research Fellows:
- Mylena Angelica Faria
- Juan Mangeira Alves
- Marcus Vinicius Martins
