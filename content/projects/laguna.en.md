This project aims to extend the massive processing of a data lake using a cloud architecture, utilizing Amazon Web Services (AWS) as the provider. To achieve this, storage and processing will be migrated from the local infrastructure to the cloud, ensuring elasticity and scalability to securely and reliably store a large amount of data.

The cloud guarantees superior computational power, providing faster data analysis with advanced tools, which are usually not available in the local infrastructure. With Laguna Cloud, it will be possible to develop a data lake specialized in Brazilian production in Science, Technology, and Innovation (ST&I), with data collected from more complex sources and with greater storage and processing capacity.

This project is a partnership between IBICT / CEDIS funded by CNPq.
